Software Engineering prjects
Absolutely! Let's integrate a focus on specific data structures for each big project:

### Week 1-2: January 29 - February 11, 2024 (Basic Python)
1. **Project 1 - Simple Calculator**
   - Description: Build a basic console-based calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Focus on user input handling and basic arithmetic operations.

2. **Project 2 - To-Do List App**
   - Description: Develop a to-do list application with a command-line interface. Allow users to add, update, and delete tasks. Utilize basic data structures (lists, dictionaries) for task storage.

3. **Project 3 - Word Frequency Counter**
   - Description: Create a program that reads a text file, counts the frequency of each word, and displays the results. Emphasize string manipulation and basic file handling.

4. **Big Project - Small Text Generator (Focus on Lists)**
   - Description: Combine the skills learned in the first two weeks to build a small text generator. Allow users to input a few sentences, and the program generates a new text based on patterns learned from the input. Focus on utilizing lists for text manipulation.

### Week 3-4: February 12 - February 25, 2024 (Intermediate Python)
5. **Project 4 - Web Scraper**
   - Description: Develop a web scraper using libraries like BeautifulSoup and requests to extract information from a website. Focus on navigating and parsing HTML content.

6. **Project 5 - File Organizer**
   - Description: Create a script that organizes files in a directory based on their types (e.g., images, documents, videos). Implement file handling and directory manipulation.

7. **Project 6 - Hangman Game**
   - Description: Build a Hangman game with a command-line interface. Implement logic for word selection, user input handling, and game progress tracking.

8. **Big Project - Basic Blog Site (Focus on Dictionaries and Lists)**
   - Description: Combine the skills learned in the third and fourth weeks to create a basic blog site. Allow users to add, edit, and delete blog posts. Use dictionaries for user information and lists for blog posts.

### Week 5-6: February 26 - March 10, 2024 (Advanced Python)
9. **Project 7 - Flask Web App**
   - Description: Develop a web application using the Flask framework. Create a simple CRUD app (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing a list of items.

10. **Project 8 - Data Visualization**
    - Description: Use a library like Matplotlib or Plotly to create visualizations. Analyze and visualize data from a CSV file or an API.

11. **Project 9 - Password Generator and Manager (Focus on Linked Lists)**
    - Description: Build a password generator and manager that generates secure passwords and stores them encrypted. Use advanced file handling and encryption techniques. Implement linked lists for efficient password storage.

12. **Big Project - Advanced Blog Site (Focus on Databases and Lists)**
    - Description: Enhance the basic blog site by adding user authentication, allowing multiple users to have their own blogs. Use Flask-SQLAlchemy for database integration. Utilize lists for blog posts.

### Week 7-8: March 11 - March 24, 2024 (Databases - MySQL)
13. **Project 10 - MySQL Database Integration**
    - Description: Integrate MySQL database into the advanced blog site to store user information and blog posts.

14. **Project 11 - MongoDB Integration**
    - Description: Replace the existing file storage with MongoDB for a more scalable solution in the advanced blog site.

### Week 9-10: March 25 - April 7, 2024 (APIs)
15. **Project 12 - RESTful API Development**
    - Description: Create a RESTful API using Flask for your blog site. Allow users to interact with the blog data through API calls.

16. **Project 13 - Algorithm Implementation (Focus on Trees)**
    - Description: Implement a sorting algorithm (e.g., quicksort or mergesort) and apply it to sort blog posts based on criteria like date or popularity. Focus on tree data structures for efficient sorting.

### Week 11-12: April 8 - April 21, 2024 (Final Refinements)
17. **Big Project - Final Enhancements and Refinements (Focus on Graphs)**
    - Description: Combine all the learned skills to create an advanced blog platform with user authentication, MySQL and MongoDB integration, RESTful API, and algorithm-based sorting. Focus on refining the user experience and adding any remaining features. Utilize graph structures for more complex relationships.
